## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

## Environment variables
**WARNING: Do not store any secrets (such as private API keys) in your React app! Environment variables are embedded into the build, meaning anyone can view them by inspecting your app's files.**

**Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT\_APP\_. Any other variables except NODE\_ENV will be ignored. Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running. These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE.**
